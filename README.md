Job Portal – Full Stack Web Application
This is a full stack Job Portal web application developed using React.js for the frontend and Java for building the backend APIs.

👩‍💻 Project Team
Frontend Developer: Usanase Nice Josiane
Backend Developer: Mugabe Ineza Promesse

📁 Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:

Frontend: Contains the user interface built with React.
Backend: Built with Java Spring Boot to handle APIs and server logic.

📌 Backend (/backend)
The src folder contains all the packages and classes used for building RESTful APIs.

Typical structure includes:
controller: Handles HTTP requests.
service: Business logic.
model: Data classes (entities).
repository: Database interaction via JPA.
config: Application configuration (e.g., security, CORS).

📌 Frontend (/frontend)
Built with React.js and structured for modular development.

Key folders:
components: Contains reusable UI components like buttons, modals, forms.
hooks: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects.
lib: Utility functions and services (like API handlers).
pages: Application views/routes (e.g., Home, Login, Job Listings).


🧠 What we Learned
Working on this project collaboratively taught me:

How to communicate effectively with team members working on different stacks.
Best practices for structuring large applications.
How frontend and backend systems interact via RESTful APIs.
The importance of version control and task division when working in teams.
